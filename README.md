# Chinook_Music_Store

This project uses SQL to answer hypothetical buisness questions. We use a version of a database called Chinook, which contains information about a fictional digital music shop (i.e. an iTunes-like store). The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. 

The analysis answers questions such as:
* What are the top selling genres in the United States?
* Which of the Chinook employees have the highest sales rates?
* Are there any sales trends by country?
* Do customers prefer buying full albums, or inidividual tracks?
